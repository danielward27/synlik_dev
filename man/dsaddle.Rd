\usage{
dsaddle(y, X, tol = 1e-06, decay = 0.5, deriv = FALSE,
  mixMethod = "mse", log = FALSE, multicore = !is.null(cluster),
  ncores = detectCores() - 1, cluster = NULL)
}
\arguments{
  \item{y}{Point at which the SPA is evaluated (d
  dimensional vector).}

  \item{X}{n by d matrix containing the data.}

  \item{tol}{Tolerance used to assess the convergence of
  the rootfinding routine used to fit the saddlepoint
  density. Default value is 1e-6.}

  \item{decay}{Rate at which the SPA falls back on a normal
  density. Should be a positive number, by default set to
  0.5.}

  \item{deriv}{If TRUE also the gradient of the
  log-saddlepoint density is returned.}

  \item{log}{If TRUE the log of the saddlepoint density is
  returned.}
}
\value{
A list with entries: \itemize{ \item{ \code{llk} }{The
value of the empirical saddlepoint at y;} \item{ \code{mix}
}{The mixture of normal-saddlepoint used (1 means only
saddlepoint);} \item{ \code{grad} }{The gradient of the
log-density at y (optional);} }
}
\description{
Gives a pointwise evaluation of the empirical saddlepoint
and optionally of its gradient at position y
